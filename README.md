# Risk Parity Revisited: Learning Ensembles of Stochastic Portfolio Selection Models for Quarterly Asset Rebalancing

## Abstract
We consider the problem of developing a flexible framework for analyzing portfolio behavior and equity market structure. This is important in a variety of problem settings where investment management practitioners wish to learn an optimal portfolio selection strategy. We describe a method for improving the predictive force of stochastic dominance models by introducing a meta-level to the estimation problem. Namely, we show that a neural network can be trained to identify the optimal portfolio selection method for a given quarter, provided descriptors of a money-marketâ€™s economic condition and the trailing performance of all strategies under consideration. We show our machine learning approach can ensemble portfolio selection models in such a way that existing individual strategies are outperformed while assuming less risk.

## Structure 
1. *model_master_script.m*
	* Master script for running and testing the model, calling helper functions 2-6 (detailed below).
	* Use *targetAlpha* to set the risk-averseness of the strategy to train.
	* Run this script to evaluate performance!
2. *calc_features.m*
	* Script for calculating and returning the predictor variables.
3. *calc_r_squared.m*
	* Calculates the statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line
4. *calc_response.m*
	* Calculates the response variable in accordance with the user's weekly alpha target.
5. *calc_returns.m*
	* Calculates the returns of all models under consideration.
6. *train_neural_net.m*
	* Script to train and initialize the neural network.
